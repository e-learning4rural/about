# Reimagining AI for learners the system overlooks.

*An international showcase of ethical, community-evaluated AI solutions for remote and marginalized education contexts*


## 🌟 What This Symposium Is About

The Inaugural Symposium on Ethical AI for Remote Learning is an online showcase for AI solutions that advance education in rural and marginalized communities.

Participants get a unique opportunity to design AI tools that are ethical, culturally grounded, and accessible, test them with real educators and learners, and gain meaningful recognition.

## 💰 Win Monetary Awards

Finalists in two tracks — Real-World Impact and Innovation — can win cash prizes for winning submissions:

### 👩‍🏫 Expert Educator Panel 
Educators from rural or under-resourced contexts evaluate:
- Feasibility  
- Pedagogical value  
- Cultural appropriateness  
- Ethical design  

### 🌍 Remote Learner Panel 
Learners from marginalized communities participate in a 14-day guided testing period. They assess:
- Usability  
- Accessibility in low-bandwidth settings  
- Cultural resonance  
- Relevance to lived learning needs  

Participation includes:
- 2–3 hours total engagement  
- Structured surveys  
- Facilitated feedback sessions  
- Fair compensation  
- Privacy and risk safeguards  


A four-hour public event featuring:
- Finalist presentations  
- Moderated Q&A  
- Reflections from educator and learner panelists  
- Community voting (non-determinative)  
- Awards ceremony

  <summary> Rubric Category: Usability & Accessibility </summary>

Example of the learner survey items:
- “I could use this tool without external help.” (1–5 scale)
- “The tool worked well with limited internet.” (1–5 scale)
- “Instructions were clear.” (1–5 scale)
- “I would use this for my own learning.” (Yes/No + Why)

Educators receive then provide evaluation:
- Quantitative averages
- Thematic summary of qualitative responses
- Flagged issues (e.g., confusion, harm concerns)
- Score “Usability & Accessibility” informed by:
  - Their professional judgment
  - Learner experience data
