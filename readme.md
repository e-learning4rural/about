**May 6 – July 6, 2026**

Teams submit:

- 🎥 5–7 minute video demonstration  
- 📄 Technical + ethical documentation  
- 🧪 Functional prototype  
  (Web-based tool, lightweight executable, or guided simulation hosted on an open repository)

**Expected submissions:** 8–12 projects

### 🔎 Phase 2 — Participatory Evaluation & Prototype Testing  
**July 7 – July 28, 2026**

All projects undergo structured, community-informed evaluation.

#### 👩‍🏫 Expert Educator Panel (5)
Educators from rural or under-resourced contexts evaluate:

- Feasibility

- Cultural appropriateness  
- Ethical design  

#### 🌍 Remote Learner Panel (10)
Learners from marginalized communities participate in a 14-day guided testing period.

They assess:

- Usability  
- Accessibility in low-bandwidth settings  
- Cultural resonance  
- Relevance to lived learning needs  

Participation includes:
- 2–3 hours total engagement  
- Structured surveys  
- Facilitated feedback sessions  
- Fair compensation  
- Privacy and risk safeguards

## 🏆 Competition Tracks

Both tracks use a shared ethical evaluation rubric.

### 🌱 Track 1 — Real-World Impact
For solutions ready (or near-ready) for deployment in under-resourced contexts.

### 💡 Track 2 — Innovation Track
For novel, experimental, or breakthrough approaches advancing ethical AI in remote learning.

* A **more formal academic version**
* Or a **high-energy call-for-submissions version** designed to attract developers.


<details>
  <summary> Rubric Category: Usability & Accessibility </summary>

Example of the learner survey items:
- “I could use this tool without external help.” (1–5 scale)
- “The tool worked well with limited internet.” (1–5 scale)
- “Instructions were clear.” (1–5 scale)
- “I would use this for my own learning.” (Yes/No + Why)

Educators receive then provide evaluation:
- Quantitative averages
- Thematic summary of qualitative responses
- Flagged issues (e.g., confusion, harm concerns)
- Score “Usability & Accessibility” informed by:
  - Their professional judgment
  - Learner experience data
