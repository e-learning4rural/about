# Reimagining AI for learners the system overlooks.

*An international showcase of ethical, community-evaluated AI solutions for remote and marginalized education contexts*


## 🌟 What This Symposium Is About

The Inaugural Symposium on Ethical AI for Remote Learning is an online showcase for AI solutions that advance education in rural and marginalized communities.

Participants get a unique opportunity to design AI tools that are ethical, culturally grounded, and accessible, test them with real educators and learners, and gain meaningful recognition.

## 💰 Win Monetary Awards

Finalists in two tracks — Real-World Impact and Innovation — can win cash prizes totaling $3,500:

| Track 1 | Track 2 |
| --: | --: |
| Real-World Impact | Innovation |
| winner: $1000 <br> Runner-up: $300 | Winner: $700 <br> Runner-up: $200 |

## How it works?
- Submit your prototype and documentation — show how your AI solution works and why it matters.
- Receive feedback from educators and remote learners — structured usability testing and surveys inform your final score.
- Present at the live online showcase — finalists share their work, reflect with panels, and compete for awards.

By participating, you’re helping shape AI that is responsible, usable, and truly equitable — and getting recognized for it.

## 📅 Program Timeline

### 🚀 Phase 1 — Submission  
**May 6 – July 6, 2026**

Teams submit:

- 🎥 5–7 minute video demonstration  
- 📄 Technical + ethical documentation  
- 🧪 Functional prototype  
  (Web-based tool, lightweight executable, or guided simulation hosted on an open repository)

**Expected submissions:** 8–12 projects

---

### 🔎 Phase 2 — Participatory Evaluation & Prototype Testing  
**July 7 – July 28, 2026**

All projects undergo structured, community-informed evaluation.

#### 👩‍🏫 Expert Educator Panel (5)
Educators from rural or under-resourced contexts evaluate:

- Feasibility  
- Pedagogical value  
- Cultural appropriateness  
- Ethical design  

#### 🌍 Remote Learner Panel (10)
Learners from marginalized communities participate in a 14-day guided testing period.

They assess:

- Usability  
- Accessibility in low-bandwidth settings  
- Cultural resonance  
- Relevance to lived learning needs  

Participation includes:
- 2–3 hours total engagement  
- Structured surveys  
- Facilitated feedback sessions  
- Fair compensation  
- Privacy and risk safeguards  

---

### 🎤 Phase 3 — Live Online Showcase  
**August 15, 2026**

A four-hour public event featuring:

- Finalist presentations  
- Moderated Q&A  
- Reflections from educator and learner panelists  
- Community voting (non-determinative)  
- Awards ceremony

## 🏆 Competition Tracks

Both tracks use a shared ethical evaluation rubric.

### 🌱 Track 1 — Real-World Impact
For solutions ready (or near-ready) for deployment in under-resourced contexts.

### 💡 Track 2 — Innovation Track
For novel, experimental, or breakthrough approaches advancing ethical AI in remote learning.


If you'd like, I can also provide:

* A **minimalist version** (less text, more impact)
* A **more formal academic version**
* Or a **high-energy call-for-submissions version** designed to attract developers.


<details>
  <summary> Rubric Category: Usability & Accessibility </summary>

Example of the learner survey items:
- “I could use this tool without external help.” (1–5 scale)
- “The tool worked well with limited internet.” (1–5 scale)
- “Instructions were clear.” (1–5 scale)
- “I would use this for my own learning.” (Yes/No + Why)

Educators receive then provide evaluation:
- Quantitative averages
- Thematic summary of qualitative responses
- Flagged issues (e.g., confusion, harm concerns)
- Score “Usability & Accessibility” informed by:
  - Their professional judgment
  - Learner experience data
